Built with empathy and intention, AGA is designed to bring clarity to the chaos by helping users break down their responsibilities into achievable steps — one unit at a time.",
    "units_core_idea": "The idea of “units” lies at the core of AGA. Each unit represents a single step toward a larger goal. First one unit cube, then ten, then a hundred, and eventually a thousand—together forming a greater whole.",
    "unit_slogan_paragraph": "This illustrates that every accomplishment is both a milestone and a stepping stone on the path to something bigger. They become milestones in a larger journey, encouraging steady forward movement. This concept inspires our slogan: “One Unit at a Time” — a reminder that progress doesn’t need to be fast or perfect; it just needs to be consistent.",
    "creator_backstory": "AGA was born from a personal struggle. The creator faced a daily battle with overwhelming responsibilities, where tasks blurred into one unmanageable mess. Traditional scheduling apps didn’t help — they lacked the connection, care, and adaptability needed in moments of stress. AGA was created to fill that gap.
