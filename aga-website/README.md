This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.

## Firebase Setup

This project uses Firebase for authentication and database storage. Before running the application, make sure to set up Firebase:

1. Create a Firebase project in the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Set up Authentication and Firestore Database
3. Create a `.env.local` file with your Firebase configuration
4. See the `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` file for detailed instructions

## Features

### Task Management System

The application includes a task management system that allows users to:

- Create, read, and delete tasks
- Set task priorities (1-5 scale)
- Schedule tasks for specific dates
- View tasks organized by date and priority

Tasks are stored in Firebase Firestore and are protected by security rules to ensure users can only access their own tasks.
